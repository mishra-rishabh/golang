## Pointers
* Pointers in Go are variables that store the memory address of another variable.
* They are a powerful tool that can be used to improve the performance and efficiency of your code.
* Pointer is nothing but a direct reference to the memory address and since we are directly passing on that address, it makes a 100% guarantee that an actual value being passed on.

### `&` Operator
* The `&` operator returns the memory address of the variable that it is applied to.
* It is also called **Address Of** operator.<br/>

### `*` Operator
* The `*` operator in Go is used to **dereference** a pointer.
* In other words, it is used to access the value of the variable that the pointer points to.
* It is also called **Value Of** operator.
* It is also used for declaring pointer variable.
* The `*` operator can also be used to modify the value of the variable that the pointer points to.
